**Work in progress**

A framework written in Julia, providing set of tools, which can be used for developemnt Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

A great place to get started would be the [Deep Learning in Spiking Neural Networks.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08150.pdf)[1]. The paper provides a great overview of where the field is today, different learning approaches, as well as results obtained by various architectures on MNIST classification. Go read the paper.
